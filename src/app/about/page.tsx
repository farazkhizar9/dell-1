        My name is Muhammad Faraz Khizar. My father’s name is Khizar Hayat.
         I am currently 19 years oldI have a strong interest in education, and I enjoy exploring new ideas and learning about technology.
I chose the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because I believe the future belongs to AI.
 This technology is rapidly transforming every industry—especially medicine and information technology (IT).
  My goal is to bring AI into the medical world to help save lives and improve healthcare systems.
Today, AI has already revolutionized fields like Web Development, and many other areas of IT.
 I want to be a part of this technological evolution and contribute to its growth.

 I am confident that technology can help solve some of the world’s biggest challenges.
